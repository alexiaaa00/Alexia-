			<h2><strong> About Me </strong></h2>
				<p>
					I was born in El Salvador, a small Central American country, where I resided for the first 4 years of my life. I then moved with my parents in 2004 to Melbourne, Florida where I began Montessori School. In 2008, we moved to Ft. Lauderdale for exactly one year, date to date and then moved to Atlanta, Georgia. We decided to finally settled down in a small suburban town called Suwanee. This is where i attnended the rest od elementary school, middle school, and graduated high school.

			<h4> Where I want to go </h4>
				<p> While studying at ESSEC, it has opened my eyes to unlimited possibilities of exposure to thousands of companies not only in France, but all around the world. As my experience ages and boradens its borders, my goal is to beome more knowledgeable in the professional world and develop a deeper understanding in how our world works. Learning about a variety of different enterprises requires having an understanding of cultures and people. Therefore I also aspire to see new countires all over the world.
